//
//  Write-time cap for the per-move ownership a GameRecord persists, so a single
//  record can never grow past CloudKit's ~1 MB per-record ceiling and wedge the
//  iCloud export queue.
//
//  Background (see project_mac_icloud_list_live_refresh): ownershipWhiteness and
//  ownershipScales are `[Int:[Float]]` keyed by move index, each value a
//  full-board (`width * height`) Float array, stored INLINE (not
//  `.externalStorage`). They grow linearly with the number of analyzed moves and
//  in one observed 14.7 MB record accounted for ~99% of the bloat (ownershipScales
//  9.7 MB + ownershipWhiteness 3.65 MB). The SwiftData @Model schema is frozen
//  (changing it corrupts CloudKit sync), so this bounds the DATA, not the field's
//  storage class.
